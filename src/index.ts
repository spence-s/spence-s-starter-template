This is a generic, but opinionated, starter template for TypeScript projects built on Node.js

To get started:

1) run 'npm install'
2) run 'npm run update' to update dependencies to their latest versions
3) run 'npm run dev' to start developing and automatically recompile and run your code when you make changes.
4) run 'npm run test' to run the tests in 'src/index.test.ts'
5) run 'npm run release' to release a new version of your package to npm
`);
}
